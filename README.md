# Language Switcher

A simple language switcher in JavaScript.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/language-switcher.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd language-switcher
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the user interface.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript that enables the language switching.
- `README.md`: This file, explaining the usage and setup.

## How It Works

- When the page loads, the content is displayed in English.
- When the user selects a different language from the dropdown menu, the text is updated to the corresponding language.
- The translations are stored in an object in the `script.js` file.

## Example

When changing the language from "English" to "Deutsch", the text changes from "Hello, World!" to "Hallo, Welt!" and the description is updated accordingly.
